ðŸŒŸ Project Accomplishment: Credit Risk Data Analysis with Python ðŸŒŸ

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, "Credit Risk Data Analysis using Python (Logistic Regression Model)", which I successfully completed as part of my Python training from Ivy Professional School.

This project was an enriching experience where I applied machine learning techniques to predict credit risk and made data-driven insights actionable. It helped me enhance my skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and building predictive models using Logistic Regression.

A heartfelt thank you to Farukh Hashmi Sir, my mentor during the Python module, for his guidance and invaluable lessons. Special gratitude to Rakib Sir for his constant support and assistance throughout the project.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow under such incredible trainers. This project has strengthened my expertise in machine learning and data analytics, preparing me for future challenges in the analytics and IT sector.

ðŸš€ Ready to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful data projects!
